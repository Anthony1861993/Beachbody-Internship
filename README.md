# Beachbody-Internship: Summer 2016
Projects that I worked on at Beachbody as an intern:

Basic PDK Drilling: 
+ General info: Make the player:
log a message to the console when the video starts. 
log a message to the console each time the video passes a 5%, 10%, 15%,... "duration" mark.
log a message to the console when the video ends.
+ Included file: player.js. 
+ Downloaded player.js from club.teambeachbody.com. 
+ Utilized Charles, a web debugging proxy, to map local files to remote locations. 
+ Utilized PDK global controllers to create listeners to tap into important events.

Basic Play/Pause Button: 
+ General info: Create a Play/Pause button on the video screen. When it is
toggled on/off, the text inside the button is changed accordingly ("Play" when
the video is paused and "Paused" when the video is playing). The state of 
the new button has to be consistent with existing Play/Pause buttons, meaning
either all of them are in the "Play" state or all of them are in
the "Pause" state. 
+ Included files: bb.js, bbPlugin.css.
+ Downloaded bb.js and bbPlugin.css from club.teambeachbody.com.
+ Utilized Charles, a web debugging proxy, to map local files to remote locations.

Mute Functionality in Video Player: 
+ General info: Add a "remember" functionality to the "mute" button of the video player so that
every time a user presses the "mute" button, the cookie will remember that state so that next time
he returns to the page, the cookie will set the mute state accordingly. The expiration
time of the cookie is 1 day. 
+ Included folder: video 
+ Utilized MAMP to manage files locally. 
+ Created a Github account and used it to make a branch and worked on that branch 
before committing all the changes to the master branch.
