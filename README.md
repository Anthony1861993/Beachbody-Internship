# Beachbody-Internship: Summer 2016
Projects that I worked on at Beachbody as an intern:

Basic PDK Drilling: 
+ Included file: player.js. 
+ Downloaded player.js from any video from club.teambeachbody.com to debug/experiment. 
+ Utilized Charles, a web debugging proxy, to map local files to remote locations. 
+ Utilized PDK global controllers to tap into some important events and make the player:
+ log a message to the console when the video starts. 
+ log a message to the console each time the video passes a 5%, 10%, 15%,... "duration" mark.
+ log a message to the console when the video ends.

Basic Play/Pause Button:
